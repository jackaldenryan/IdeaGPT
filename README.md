## How it works

When you click "Generate" your prompt (with some automatic additions) is sent to one of OpenAI's latest models (gpt-4o-mini or gpt-4o). The additions to your prompt are just the previously generated ideas, whether each one was marked as "good" or not, and the feedback for each one if any is given (not required).

## Tech stack

This project uses Next.js, Typescript, and Tailwind and is deployed on Vercel. For user authentication and database management, it uses Supabase.
