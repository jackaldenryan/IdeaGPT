TODOs:

- for now, just let users use with my API and restrict usage to like $10
- deploy to vercel

- Payment and Free uses
    - Have to be signed in to use at all
    - For each user, we track usage
        - Once it reaches threshold, we prevent further usage for that user
        - It then directs them to a pricing page that shows three options, each one with different usage limits
            - Idea before thinking of economics:
                - Free (20 generations / week)
                - Pro ($2 / month, 200 gens / week)
                    - Cancel easily anytime and retain membership for the remainder of the month
                - Unlimited ($6 / month, 2,000 generations / week)
- Ensure checkout, pricing, settings pages all work properly
- Vercel

- Checks before actually deploy:
    - security
        - SQL injection
        - user input validation
        - account and data security
        - payment information security




UI nice-to-have:
- main app page: prompt box too low
- auto scroll to bottom when new ideas generated
- Sign in-page
    - implement "remember me"
    - implement email verification
    - googel and facebook actually integrate for signing in
    - better font
- implement sign out functionality
- implement user profile management
- clear chat button
    - one day: new chat button + saving old chat
- if there is exact duplicate, checkbox and reason automatically same (is this good to keep? Whats going on?)
- better advanced options menu
- loading symbol
- Demarking line between sets of ideas that had different prompt
    - and maybe some note thing you can hover over that expands and tells you what the prompt was
- "Enter" makes the prompt generate and ctrl-enter adds
- when the text box gets bigger, it exapnds upward and never downward
- Way to select ideas and save them to either a new “idea file” or append them to existing. Idea file is a lot like a previous chat, but you can upload an idea file to a new chat to instantiate it with labelled ideas. Can also download the idea file locally if you want
